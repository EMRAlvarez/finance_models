# Financial Models Repo

A place where I store any open-source financial modelling Python scripts. Currently this consists of a [cashflow model](http://jamescalam.github.io/finance_models/cashflow_eir/readme.html) which can also be used for effective interest rate (EIR), net present value (NPV), and profile and loss (P&L) calculations.
